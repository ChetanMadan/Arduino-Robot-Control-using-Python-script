In this project I am using a PC to send commands to an Arduino based Robot. The transmitter consists of an RF 433 MHz Transmitter module connected to an Arduino Uno / Pro mini / Nano / Mega.The Transmitter Arduino is connected to a laptop/PC via a USB cable for Serial Communication. In our case the Receiver Arduino is a being used to control a Differential Drive Robot. The Receiver Arduino is mounted with an RF 433MHz Receiver Module.
