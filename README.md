# Arduino-Robot-Control-using-Python-script
In this project I am using a PC to send commands to an Arduino based Robot. The transmitter consists of an RF 433 MHz Transmitter module connected to an Arduino Uno / Pro mini / Nano / Mega.The Transmitter Arduino is connected to a laptop/PC via a USB cable for Serial Communication. In our case the Receiver Arduino is a being used to control a Differential Drive Robot. The Receiver Arduino is mounted with an RF 433MHz Receiver Module.

### Steps for Running Python Script
- To Execute the Python Script we need to install Pygame library
- You need pip(package installer for python) to install pygame library.
- If you don't have pip installed in your system, install pip from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
- run command in terminal or cmd `pip install pygame` or `sudo pip install pygame`
- to run the script run the command in terminal or cmd `python Python_script_transmitter.py`
